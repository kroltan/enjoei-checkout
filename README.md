Technical test for a frontent job position.

## running

The following command will start a development server:
```
npm start
```

## deploying

To run in "production", first, build the application:
```
npm run build
```

This will generate a folder called `build` in the project root.

Then, navigate to the `build` folder, and run `node server.js`.

Alternatively you can copy `server.js` into the `build` folder so it
can run completely separate from the rest of the source code.
